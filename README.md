# Paper-Recyclability-Detection using YOLOv8

This project focuses on detecting the recyclability of paper using the Yolov8 object detection model. The model classifies papers into two categories: recyclable and non-recyclable, based on the recycling standard of the National Solid Waste Management Commission, and only includes paper with stains, tape, braille, and waterproof papers as non-recyclable.
Features
•	Real-time Detection: Utilizes the OpenCV library to incorporate the usage of webcam.
•	Custom Dataset: Trained on a curated dataset of approximately 18,000 images (9,000 for each class), including a variety of paper types with recyclable and non-recyclable attributes.
•	Achieved strong metrics such as mAP (Mean Average Precision) during evaluation.
Dataset
The dataset used to train the model was created collaboratively by me and my team member. It was available publicly for testing, and for more information, visit [Paper Recyclability Detection](https://universe.roboflow.com/serge-de-guzman-and-christian-gomez/paper-recyclability-detection).
Performance Metrics
Below are the key performance metrics for the model on the validation dataset. Detailed images of the confusion matrix, mAP curves, and other evaluation results are provided in the performance_metrics folder.
